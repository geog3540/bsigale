						<p>
							Hurricanes are one of the most devastating natural disasters which can occur, causing hundreds of lives lost and billions in damages. One of the most critical parts
							of hurricane preparedness is safe evacuation routes, as the best way to protect yourself from a hurricane is to simply not go near it. The focus of this project is to examine
							the relationship between hurricane evacuation routes and social vulnerability, as defined and reported in the <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html" target="_blank"> CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)</a>.
							The SVI identifies important demographic data, such as unemployment rates and access to a vehicle, to rank census block groups in relation to one another. This was designed in partnership with the ATSDR's Geospatial Research, Analysis & Services Program (GRASP) to help first responders identify where communities were hit hardest. By integrating additional data, such as historical high water marks and distance to evacuation routes, this response can be augmented to further identify areas which need help most immediately.
						</p>

						<p>
							This particular data representation was performed using a clipping of the SVI from <a href="https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/c2df2a80b9d6490788704a24854f4879/" target="_blank">Hydroshare.org</a> containing the SVI information
							for areas affected by Hurricane Harvey. Hurricane Harvey occurred in August 2017 and caused billions in damage to the Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama coasts, as well as significant damage in the Bahamas. This analysis was performed
							on data from Texas, as Texas has been notorious in past hurricanes to have millions stranded in highway traffic jams during hurricane evacuations. While this is not a problem exclusive to Texas by any means, Texas is a great location
							for this analysis as Houston, a very economically and socially diverse large city, was right in the middle of Hurricane Harvey. Understanding disparities in evacuation route access could help urban planners ensure the safety of citizens
							in their communities.

							<p>
								Also incorporated into this data is US Geological Survey (USGS) recorded high water marks heights, recorded in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane. This data was initially formatted as individual points, but was aggregated
								by census block group for this analysis. This analysis was performed using ArcPy, which allows the user to group points by outer bounding boxes (in this case, the census block group), and perform summary statistics. For this analysis,
								the average height of high water marks in each census block group was used.
							</p>

							<p style="padding-left: 3%">
								<i><strong>Note:</strong> Because USGS High Water Marks sometimes contained sporadic measurements, especially in the downtown Houston area, some census block groups are not represented. In the future,
									it would be nicer to have these additional values to help further understand the relationships between poverty, flood damage, and access to evacuation routes.</i>
							</p>

							<p style="padding-right: 15px;">
								This analysis was performed on data from Hurricane Harvey, one of the most devastating hurricanes in recent memory. The map and parallel coordinates plot below
								helps understand if there is a relationship between access to a hurricane route and SVI ranking, with some additional values to help interpret what those SVI rankings translate to. In order, the data used in this analysis is:

								<ul>
								  <li><strong>% Poverty:</strong> Estimated percent of the census block group which falls below the poverty line.</li>
									<li><strong>% Unemployed:</strong> Estimated percent of the census block group which is unemployed.</li>
									<li><strong>% Mobile:</strong> Estimated percent of the census block group which lives in a mobile home.</li>
									<li><strong>% Multi-Unit:</strong> Estimated percent of the census block group which lives in a multi-unit structure (10 or more units).</li>
									<li><strong>% No Vehicle:</strong> Estimated percent of the census block group which does not over a vehicle.</li>
									<li><strong>Mean Water Height:</strong> Average USGS High Water Mark height in the census block group.</li>
									<li><strong>SVI Percentile:</strong> Percentile ranking on the SVI. Closer to 1 indicates a highly vulnerable community.</li>
									<li><strong>Closest On-Ramp (m):</strong> Euclidean (not following streets) distance in meters to the nearst evacuation route on-ramp.</li>
								</ul>

								The map below allows zooming and panning. Change the data the map is displaying using the dropdown on the right. If an area is grey, the value is either 0 or missing. Any census block group you hover over will have its statistics displayed in the parallel coordinates plot below. In addition, you can click and drag over different on the parallel coordinates plot to highlight census block groups with statistics fitting into those selected ranges. Click outside the range to reset the view.
